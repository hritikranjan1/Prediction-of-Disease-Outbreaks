## Prediction of Disease Outbreaks 🏥

## Overview
This is a **Machine Learning-based Disease Prediction System** developed using **Streamlit**, which allows users to predict the likelihood of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease based on user input.

## Features 🚀
- **Diabetes Prediction** 🩸
- **Heart Disease Prediction** ❤️
- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction** 🧠
- User-friendly UI built with **Streamlit**
- Uses pre-trained **Machine Learning Models** for prediction

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Python** 🐍
- **Streamlit** (for UI) 🎨
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning Models) 🤖
- **Pickle** (Model Serialization) 📦
- **GitHub** (Version Control) 🗂️

## Installation & Setup 🏗️
### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hritikranjan1/Prediction-of-Disease-Outbreaks.git
cd Prediction_of_Disease_Outbreaks
```

### Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application
```sh
streamlit run main.py
```

## Usage 📖
1. Select a disease prediction option from the sidebar.
2. Enter the required medical details in the form.
3. Click the **Prediction Button** to get results.
4. The model will classify whether the person has the disease or not.
